# @docx-editor.dev/fonts

Load open-licensed substitutes for common Word fonts. The docx-editor engine uses these fonts to measure and render text.

| Word font       | Substitute        | License           |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Calibri         | Carlito           | SIL OFL           |
| Cambria         | Caladea           | SIL OFL           |
| Times New Roman | Liberation Serif  | SIL OFL           |
| Arial           | Liberation Sans   | SIL OFL           |
| Courier New     | Liberation Mono   | SIL OFL           |
| Century Gothic  | TeX Gyre Adventor | GUST Font License |

The first five substitutes target matching advance widths for the glyphs they cover. TeX Gyre Adventor is slightly narrower than Century Gothic; the measured difference stays within 1% in `bun run check:font-width-fidelity`. Kerning and glyph differences can still change line breaks. For the original glyphs, supply licensed font bytes through `loadFonts()` from `@docx-editor.dev/core/editor`.

Packaged faces do not cover every script. Liberation Sans has no Arabic glyphs. The editor keeps native family fallback available for missing glyphs. Exact metrics still depend on the font available for that script.

`loadDefaultFonts()` and `defaultFonts()` load the five default families. To include Century Gothic, pass `families: ALL_WORD_DEFAULT_FAMILIES`. Its substitute adds about 709 KB. Alternatively, `googleFonts()` loads it from packaged assets when the document requests it.

## Install the package

Install the fonts package and its required engine peer:

```sh
npm install @docx-editor.dev/fonts @docx-editor.dev/core
```

## Load fonts

Use `packagedFonts()` to load document fonts on demand. In React, `useFonts()` keeps the resolver identity stable so rerenders do not rebuild the editor.

```tsx
import { packagedFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/fonts';
import { DocxEditor, useFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/react';

function Editor({ bytes }: { bytes: Uint8Array }) {
  const fonts = useFonts(packagedFonts());
  return <DocxEditor document={bytes} fonts={fonts} />;
}
```

To add Google Fonts, import its resolver and pass it after `packagedFonts()`:

```ts
import { googleFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/fonts/google';

const fonts = useFonts(packagedFonts(), googleFonts());
```

Call `useFonts()` inside a component.

To load all 20 faces of the five default families before opening a document, use `defaultFonts()`. This loads 7.4 MB and avoids repagination when fonts arrive:

```ts
import { createDocxEditor } from '@docx-editor.dev/core/editor';
import { defaultFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/fonts';

const fonts = await defaultFonts(); // Add families to load a subset.
const editor = createDocxEditor({ document: bytes, fonts });
```

## Relocate packaged fonts in Node or Bun

For a single-file executable, copy the contents of the fonts package's `assets/` directory into a dedicated directory. Set `DOCX_EDITOR_FONT_ASSET_ROOT` before starting the process:

```bash
DOCX_EDITOR_FONT_ASSET_ROOT=/opt/my-app/fonts ./my-app
```

The directory must contain the packaged `.ttf` and `.otf` files with their original names. Use an absolute filesystem path or a `file:` URL. Relative paths, filesystem roots, and non-file URLs are ignored.

The package reads this setting when its module loads. Setting it after importing the package does not relocate the fonts. The setting changes packaged asset locations; it does not register custom fonts or enable a font source. Configure `packagedFonts()` or `defaultFonts()` as usual. Browser builds use their bundled asset URLs.

## Custom fonts for the editor

Use `customFonts()` to supply brand fonts or licensed Word fonts to the editor. Put it first so your supplied faces take precedence.

```tsx
import { customFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/core/editor';
import { packagedFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/fonts';
import { googleFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/fonts/google';
import { DocxEditor, useFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/react';

function Editor({ bytes }: { bytes: Uint8Array }) {
  const fonts = useFonts(
    customFonts({
      sources: [
        {
          url: '/fonts/AcmeSans-Regular.ttf',
          family: 'Acme Sans',
          weight: 400,
          style: 'normal',
        },
        {
          url: '/fonts/AcmeSans-Bold.ttf',
          family: 'Acme Sans',
          weight: 700,
          style: 'normal',
        },
      ],
      onFailure: (failure) => console.warn(failure.request.family, failure.reason),
    }),
    packagedFonts(),
    googleFonts()
  );
  return <DocxEditor document={bytes} fonts={fonts} />;
}
```

`customFonts()` loads all configured faces when the editor resolves its fonts. Creating the resolver does not fetch files. It skips faces supplied by earlier sources, matching the family name without case sensitivity and matching weight and style.

Loaded fonts appear in the picker, including in blank documents. Select a font to apply it to document text.

The helper uses `loadFonts` for validation and caching. `onFailure` receives each failed face and defaults to `console.warn`. Cancellation does not trigger `onFailure`. Core registers the supplied bytes under private names, without changing fonts elsewhere in your app.

`loadFonts()` from Core remains the lower-level eager loader. It starts loading every listed source when called and returns validated bytes with a typed `failures` list.

## Font registration

`defaultFonts()` and `packagedFonts()` supply font bytes for the editor. Core registers these bytes under private font names. Your app's header and sidebar keep their existing fonts. Native fonts remain available for glyphs missing from the substitutes.

### Upgrade from page-wide registration

Before 2.18.0, loaders could register substitutes under public names such as `Arial`. From 2.18.0, font loaders supply bytes for private editor registration only. If you already pass `packagedFonts()` or `defaultFonts()` through the editor's `fonts` option, keep that configuration.

The `packagedFonts` option `install` is deprecated and ignored, including `true`. Remove it while keeping your other loader options:

```diff
- fonts: packagedFonts({ install: true, onFailure })
+ fonts: packagedFonts({ onFailure })
```

`installDefaultFontFaces()` is deprecated. It does nothing and resolves to `0`, without fetching or registering fonts. Remove its calls and supply `packagedFonts()` or `defaultFonts()` through the editor's `fonts` option instead. `defaultFonts()` has no `install` option. `loadDefaultFonts()` remains bytes-only.

If surrounding app text relied on these public fonts, configure those fonts separately with your app's CSS or font loader. Check the fonts in your app's headers, sidebars, and other text after upgrading.

Importing the package does not fetch fonts. Configure a loader or resolver to enable them.

Font binaries ship as separate files (`assets/*.ttf` and `assets/*.otf`) fetched per requested family. Each face's `sha256:` hash is baked at packaging time (`src/manifest.generated.ts`) and CI-verified against the shipped bytes.

## Google Fonts, on demand

`@docx-editor.dev/fonts/google` includes a font catalog without bundling its font files. It fetches fonts requested by the document or its default face.

```tsx
import { googleFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/fonts/google';
import { DocxEditor, useFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/react';

function Editor({ bytes }: { bytes: Uint8Array }) {
  const fonts = useFonts(googleFonts());
  return <DocxEditor document={bytes} fonts={fonts} />;
}
```

The editor requests fonts on load and when edits or font selection introduce new families.

A document that uses Calibri loads Carlito, its metric-compatible substitute. The document's default face also counts as a request. Use `allow` to restrict the catalog.

Resolution checks these sources in order:

1. Your `substitute` mappings, merged over the built-in substitutions.
2. Packaged assets for Century Gothic, which needs no third-party request.
3. A direct match in the Google Fonts catalog.

If no source matches, the editor keeps its fallback measurement. It does not infer width-compatible substitutes from the document's PANOSE font classification. Supply your own font bytes when you need a specific face.

Google Fonts requests disclose the requested families to the content delivery network. Use `packagedFonts()` for packaged assets, or restrict remote requests with `googleFonts({ allow: ['Tinos', 'Lato'] })`. When composed after another resolver, Google Fonts skips families whose faces are already loaded. A partially loaded family still requires its remaining faces.

## Maintain the catalog

The generated catalog pins each face to an immutable `google/fonts` commit and a `sha256:` hash. Family names are lookup keys, never URL fragments. The catalog requires regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic static faces that pass validation. When upstream provides only variable fonts, the catalog can pin an earlier commit with static files. The shaper does not support variable font axes.

Run these commands from `packages/fonts`:

```bash
# Download fonts and regenerate the catalog and hashes.
bun run google:catalog

# Download catalog faces and verify their hashes.
bun run google:verify
```

From the repository root, run `bun run check:google-catalog` to check the committed catalog offline. CI runs the same check. `bun run check:font-width-fidelity` compares synthetic text measurements with font subsets embedded in Word PDF exports.

## Licenses

The packaged fonts include license texts in `licenses/`. Carlito, Caladea, and Liberation use the SIL Open Font License. TeX Gyre Adventor uses the GUST Font License. The package code uses Apache-2.0.

The GUST Font License incorporates the LaTeX Project Public License 1.3c or any later version. It also requests that you rename modified fonts. Both texts ship in `licenses/`. The package identifies this license as `LicenseRef-GUST-Font-License` because GUST has no SPDX identifier.
