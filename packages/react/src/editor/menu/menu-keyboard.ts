// Keyboard navigation for the menu bar, as DOM helpers rather than an item registry.
//
// The bar declares `menubar`/`menu`/`menuitem`, and those roles are a PROMISE: a screen
// reader switches to focus mode on them and hands arrow keys to the widget. Declaring the
// role without implementing the keys is worse than plain buttons — browse mode, which
// would at least have let the user read the items, is suppressed, and nothing answers the
// arrows. So the keys are implemented here and the roles are earned.
//
// Items are FOUND IN THE DOM rather than registered, because the panels are built from
// registry data, host overrides, and arbitrary children in any mix — a registry would have
// to be threaded through every one of those and would go stale the moment a host composed
// something the parts do not know about. Querying is one selector and cannot drift from
// what is actually rendered.
//
// Disabled rows are NOT skipped. They carry `aria-disabled` (not the native attribute)
// precisely so they stay focusable, so the engine's reason is reachable by the users who
// cannot hover to read a tooltip.
