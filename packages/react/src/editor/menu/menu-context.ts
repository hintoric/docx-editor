// File rows need, published by the root to its parts.
//
// Open, save and page setup are the rows whose dispatch is NOT an engine command — bytes
// and dialog values cross the host boundary — so the root resolves each to a single
// handler (host override, else the packaged default) and the rows only call it. A row
// never decides policy; it renders what the context gives it.
//
// Like the toolbar context, no user-facing English lives here: labels are i18n keys from
// the chrome registry, resolved through the host's `t` or the active `LocaleContext`
// catalogue — the same default the packaged `<DocxEditor>` uses. The context menu's rows
// resolve through `useMenuLabel` too, so this one fallback covers both surfaces.
