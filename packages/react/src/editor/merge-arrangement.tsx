// The default-set + in-place-override merge, once.
//
// The toolbar, the menu bar and the context menu all offer the same contract: with no
// children you get the packaged arrangement, a child that NAMES a member of it replaces
// that member where it stands, `hidden` removes it, anything else appends, and
// `preset={false}` opts out entirely. Each of them had grown its own copy of the algorithm,
// with the same comments word-for-word — and the copies had already diverged in a way that
// bit: the context menu's forgot to unwrap Fragments, so a host mapping over its overrides
// got a SECOND copy of the row it was trying to replace instead of an override.
//
// Keeping the identification separate from the merge is what lets the three share this:
// each surface still decides what counts as a key (a `ChromeSlotId`, a menu row id, a
// context-menu row id) and how to render a default; only the merge is common.
