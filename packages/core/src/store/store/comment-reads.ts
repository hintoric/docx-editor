// Comment anchors, comment bodies, and the sibling parts that hold thread state.
//
// An anchor is a RANGE over stable node identities plus UTF-16 offsets, in the same offset
// space layout and tree ops use. `w:commentRangeStart` / `w:commentRangeEnd` are empty elements
// that sit between runs, so they contribute no characters and mark a position rather than
// occupying one.
//
// ECMA-376 governs the anchor: `CT_Comment` (§17.13.4.2) carries `@w:id`, `@w:author`,
// `@w:initials` and `@w:date` and a body, and `CT_Markup`-derived range markers (§17.13.4.4,
// §17.13.4.3) place it. It defines NEITHER threading nor a resolved flag — a comment in Part 1
// is flat and open. Both live in namespaces outside Part 1, so this reader treats them as
// optional evidence rather than as structure the standard promises:
//
//   - `commentsExtended.xml`, `w15:commentEx` `@paraIdParent` / `@done`, keyed by `w14:paraId`.
//   - `@w16cid:parentId` on `w:comment`, naming the parent's `w:id` directly.
//
// A file using neither can still state a reply in Part 1 terms alone, by anchoring it over
// exactly the characters the parent covers — the ranges are the only part of a thread that
// survives a producer dropping the extension parts. Read all three, explicit before inferred;
// a comment whose text merely opens with "Reply:" is prose and is never treated as structure.
//
// IT LIVES IN THE STORE LANE, so every lane reads a reviewer's remarks through one derivation.
// The paginated surface, the review rail and the automation host all ask "what comments does
// this document hold", and the answer is a property of the canonical tree rather than of any one
// of their views — layout re-exports what is here rather than owning it. The bounded whole-part
// walk covers body, furniture, every normal note, separator and continuation-separator content,
// and nested textboxes without making any one layout story model the store's authority.
