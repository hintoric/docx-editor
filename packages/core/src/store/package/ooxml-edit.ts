// The ONLY sanctioned way to mutate an `OoxmlPart`. Every primitive is pure — it returns a
// new part and never mutates the input, which is deep-frozen anyway — and every result is
// re-validated through `validateOoxmlPart` before it is handed back, unless the caller
// explicitly DEFERS that validation to its own commit boundary (see `EditOptions`). An edit
// that would break an invariant returns its issues and NO part, so a caller cannot
// half-apply one.

// These exist for `DocumentStore` transactions to call; nothing else should reach for them.
// The store composes one or more primitives per `DocOp` and publishes a single revision, so
// atomicity at this layer is what makes atomicity at that layer possible.
//
// Identity follows `OOXML_NODE_IDENTITY_RULES`:
//   - untouched subtrees are STRUCTURALLY SHARED, so their ids survive by construction;
//   - a rebuilt ancestor chain keeps its own id (the node is the same node, its children
//     changed), which is what lets a paragraph edit leave every sibling id stable;
//   - genuinely new nodes get freshly allocated ids that cannot collide within the part.
