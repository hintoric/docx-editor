 *
 * Positioning each word independently meant the browser drew the selection highlight once
 * per word, so a selected line came out as a row of separate blocks with seams between
 * them instead of one continuous band. It also put every word at a measured x that
 * disagreed with the rendered advance by a fraction of a pixel, and made `vertical-align`
 * inert — superscript had nothing to align against.
 *
 * `white-space: pre` keeps the browser from re-wrapping a line layout already decided, so
 * a line that measured slightly wide overflows by a hair rather than becoming two lines.

  // The layer is therefore an ordinary line of text in the run's own face, with the LINE's
  // line-height — the same two things `paintLine` gives the text beside it, so the browser
  // resolves the identical baseline. Earlier attempts hung the glyphs off a zero-size strut
  // and tried to place that strut's baseline arithmetically; a strut with no metrics puts
  // its baseline at half the line-height (the vertical centre), and an inline-block aligns
  // by its OWN internal baseline rather than the one the arithmetic targeted, so the dots
  // came out first centred and then below the text. Matching the text's own setup is the
  // only version that needs no correction.
  // MIRROR `paintLine` EXACTLY, because the baseline is whatever that structure resolves
  // to and no arithmetic here can second-guess it: strut killed with `font-size: 0`, the
  // published line height as an explicit line-height, and the glyphs as a baseline-aligned
  // inline-block carrying their own BAND height — the run's own height plus the line's
  // extra leading, capped at the line box — over an inner line box one leading taller, so
  // a spaced line's leading is padded off the top of the dots exactly as it is off the text.
  // Leaving the band off let the glyphs inherit the whole line height, and their inner line
  // box then centred them; putting the face on the container instead gave the strut
  // different metrics from the dots and floated them.
  //
  // The mirror is literal, so it has to be MAINTAINED as one: both sides read `line.leading`,
