// Joining two paragraphs the reader sees as neighbours when the tree holds, between them,
// paragraphs a hidden mark removed from the flow (see `layout/hidden-paragraph-mark.ts`).
//
// Those paragraphs show nothing, so Backspace or Delete at the visible break means "join the
// two paragraphs on either side". A `joinParagraphs` of just those two is refused
// (`not-adjacent-siblings`), because joins need true child-index adjacency. The join instead
// absorbs each removed paragraph into the first paragraph on the way. The first paragraph
// keeps its properties, and whatever a removed paragraph holds (hidden runs, tracked content
// this view does not show) moves with it unchanged, so nothing the reader can see changes
// except the break they deleted.
//
// Which paragraphs count as removed is LAYOUT'S answer for the view being edited, not a
// separate rule: a paragraph whose only content is a tracked deletion is removed in the
// proposed view and shown in all-markup, and editing has to agree with the page either way.
//
// The caret can still come to rest in such a paragraph: Enter at the end of a paragraph whose
// mark is hidden makes an empty one, and deleting the last character of one empties it. A
// break the reader cannot see is not a place they can see either, so a caret there SHOWS at
// the start of the paragraph that takes the join, and the arrow keys move from there. Typing
// still lands in the paragraph itself, which then shows again, and so do the other lanes that
// insert at the caret. Paragraph and character formatting, and the toolbar state that reports
// it, read the paragraph where the caret shows. Backspace and Delete act on
// that paragraph first: both join it into the paragraph before it, which is the exact reverse
// of the Enter that made it, and only then act from the shown position.
