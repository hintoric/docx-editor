/**
 * The review writes a replica admits, and nothing else.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, including for an unnamed intent. Review writes reach the store directly instead of
 * through `applyTreeOps`, and the ones that graft a package and swap the shell record no primitive
 * effects, so they replicate as nothing at all — the peer keeps a `commentReference` naming a
 * comment it never got, which is a corrupt document produced silently. A refusal the user can see
 * is the better failure. Add an intent here only with a two-replica test behind it.
 *
 * Every named intent is admitted today. The set stays, and stays fail-closed, because it is what
 * makes the next review write declare itself before a replica carries it.
