// Where a destructive or replacing gesture acts, and what it takes (paginated-surface seam).
//
// One lane for the two questions every edit asks before it writes: which range the selection
// really covers at this revision, and — once a tracked strike has had its say — where content
// replacing that range belongs. `surface-selection-ops.ts` holds the pure half (document
// order, coverage, the deletion planner itself); this holds the BOUND half, the part that
// needs the session, the editing mode and the caret-format rules to answer.
//
// It lives here rather than in `surface-selection-ops.ts` because that module promises to be
// a plain input-to-output computation with no session and no DOM, and these functions read
// `session`, the editing mode and the configured author. Two shapes in one file would
// falsify that promise, which is what makes the pure half cheap to test.
//
// EVERY MUTABLE MOUNT LOCAL ARRIVES AS A GETTER, never as a captured value. `selection`,
// `currentLayout`, `cellSelection` and `editingMode` all move during a gesture, and
// `deleteSelectionPlan` is called from inside a commit whose head nulls the rectangle — so a
// snapshot taken at factory time would answer for a state the plan was not built from.
//
// The getters are also called AT THE ORIGINAL READ POINTS, not hoisted to the top of a
// function. `orderedRange()` flushes pending input, which republishes the layout, so a
// `deps.layout()` lifted above a flush would hand the caller the pre-flush revision — the
// stale-oracle bug this lane's own comments are about.

// The VIEW, not the concrete binding session: `paginated-surface.ts` is the only file in
// this lane allowed to name that one (`store/__tests__/prosemirror-isolation.test.ts`).
