// which would take in everything painted in between and let a single delete unpick the table.
// A word processor selects the rectangle, and so does this.
//
// It is expressed as a SIBLING of the text selection rather than a variant of it. A union
// would push a narrowing branch into every reader of `SemanticSelection` — ordering, deletion,
// clipboard, formatting, viewport pinning, the DOM mirror — and each is one future edit away
// from forgetting it. Carrying an equivalent TEXT range inside the cell selection instead
// means every one of those keeps working untouched, and only the readers that genuinely want
// the rectangle ask for it.
