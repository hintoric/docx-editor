// Revision-tagged semantic layout records over the canonical tree (task 7.1).
//
// These are the records everything downstream reads: interaction derives caret stops and hit
// regions from them (7.4), output paints them without remeasuring (7.5), and the incremental
// engine reuses them by identity (section 9). So they carry two things the painted DOM
// cannot supply back:
//
//   - a REVISION, so a consumer can tell a stale layout from a current one rather than
//     assuming whatever it holds is fresh;
//   - a stable SOURCE RANGE on every line and span — paragraph node id plus UTF-16 offsets —
//     so a position on screen maps to a position in the model without a DOM lookup.
//
// Measurement is a PORT. This package is DOM-free by construction, and a layout that could
// only run in a browser could not be tested deterministically or run headless.
