 * depend on point size, so the first caller's size may settle it.
 *
 * The probe is LATIN lowercase, so a face carrying `smcp` for Latin alone answers yes and a
 * mixed-script small-caps run shapes its Greek or Cyrillic lowercase at plain advances while
 * paint synthesizes small caps for them. A span and its prefixes still come from one source,
 * which is what the caret needs; the absolute width of that span is still a fraction out.
 * Widening the probe to every script a face might cover is the fix for the width, and it is
