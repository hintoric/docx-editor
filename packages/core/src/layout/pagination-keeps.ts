// Word's paragraph-level pagination controls: widow/orphan, keep-with-next, keep-lines.
//
// These decide WHERE a paragraph is allowed to cross a page boundary, not how it measures.
// `semantic-layout.ts` owns the flow cursor and calls in here for the decision, so the rule
// itself stays a pure function of line counts and can be reasoned about (and tested) without
// a page, a measurer or a DOM.
//
// All three are style-inheritable, so they are read from the CASCADED paragraph property bag
// (`docDefaults` → `basedOn` chain → style → direct), the same bag `w:pageBreakBefore` and
// `w:spacing` are read from. Reading direct `w:pPr` alone would miss every heading that gets
// its `w:keepNext` from the `Heading 1` style — which is all of them.
//
// Everything here fails OPEN. A keep rule that cannot be honoured places the content anyway,
// because Word does the same: a paragraph taller than a page still prints, and a keep chain
// that cannot fit is abandoned rather than looped over.
//
// Modern-mode table paragraphs also use widow/orphan control when a row crosses pages. The
// table placer decides the cut before publishing lines; exact-height rows still clip.
// Cross-paragraph keep chains remain body-flow decisions, while row atomicity is owned
// by `w:cantSplit`. A body keep-next chain cannot price a table and stops there.

 * every interior boundary carries the `between` rule instead of a top and a bottom. So a
 * paragraph's own bottom edge — which rule is drawn, how much vertical extent it claims, and
 * whether it publishes a `bottomBorder` record at all — is a function of the block AFTER it.
 *
 * Nothing about that reaches the block's content key, so the incremental pass resumed past a
 * paragraph that had just stopped being the last of its group and kept the closing edge it no
 * longer owned. The extent is real height, so the error compounds down the flow: a
 * three-paragraph group edited on its last member laid out over three pages where the same
 * bytes reopened took two.
 *
 * Both bits go in, not only the forward one. Incremental RESUME is a prefix cut, where a
 * backward dependency is safe because the earlier block moving re-places everything after it.
 * The convergence tail is a SUFFIX cut, where backward is the exposed direction: a block can
 * sit inside the common suffix while the paragraph above it joins or leaves its group.
 *
 * No repro is known for that, and the reason is worth writing down: the tail's guard compares
 * fragment SIGNATURES, and `semantic-fragment-signature.ts` hashes every `w:pBdr` stroke, so
 * even a height-neutral group change (a different `w:color` on the same `w:sz`) moves the
 * signature of the paragraph that changed. `above` is folded anyway. That guard only sees a
 * changed paragraph still pending on the page being built, it is not the guard that owns this
 * question, and the bit is free — one string comparison the fold already has in hand.
 *
 * `groupKeyAt` answers `''` for a block that can never group: a table, or a paragraph with no
 * borders at all. Two paragraphs group only when their keys are EQUAL, which is what makes an
 * indent change split a group — the key carries the box geometry as well as the rules.
