// A STORY is a flowable sequence of blocks: the body of the main document, the whole

// or a single footnote/endnote node. This is the single place that knows which roots
// flow and how block-level content controls flatten — via shared `collectFlowBlocks`.
//
// SDT content flattens TRANSPARENTLY: the paragraphs and tables inside `w:sdtContent`
// join the flow in reading order (Word renders them in place), while the `w:sdt` wrapper
// itself stays structurally preserved for serialization. SDT chrome — placeholder text,
// locks, dropdown behaviour — is not modelled here.
//
// Note parts (`w:footnotes` / `w:endnotes`) are NOT story roots: each typed `w:footnote` /
// `w:endnote` child is its own story via {@link noteStoryBlocks}.
