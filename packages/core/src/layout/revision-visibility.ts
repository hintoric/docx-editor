// Which paragraphs a tracked revision removes from the laid-out document.
//
// A `w:del` on the paragraph MARK (17.13.5.15, `w:pPr/w:rPr/w:del`) says the mark itself was
// deleted, which in Word joins the paragraph to the one after it. When everything the
// paragraph would have rendered is deleted too, that join leaves nothing at all — Word shows
// no line where the paragraph was.
//
// Layout does not render deleted run content (a `w:del` is not a run container it walks, and
// `w:delText` is not model text), so such a paragraph reaches pagination with no spans and
// still claims a full line box. A cell of them is a stack of blank lines that pushes real
// content down the page and off it. This module identifies exactly that case.
//
// The narrow condition matters. A paragraph whose CONTENT is deleted but whose mark survives
// is a paragraph Word still shows as empty, and suppressing it would delete a blank line the
// document really has. A paragraph whose mark is deleted but which still renders something
// has to keep its box, because that content is visible and Word merely merges it forward —
// dropping it would lose text. Only the intersection is removed.

/**
 * Whether the paragraph would put any text on the page.
 *
 * Judged in the view this suppression MODELS: the one where the mark deletion has been
 * accepted and the paragraph joined the next. There, deleted content is gone and inserted
 * content stays, so `w:del` and `w:moveFrom` render nothing while `w:ins` and `w:moveTo` are
 * descended into like any other run container — as is `w:hyperlink`, and either can hold the
 * other. Inline content controls flatten the same way layout does.
 *
 * Not mode-parameterised on purpose. `storyBlocks` is indexed by section addressing, so a
 * block list that changed shape with the display mode would move section boundaries under it.
 *
 * Descending into insertions is load-bearing: a paragraph whose mark is struck and whose
 * content is an insertion is Word's shape for "this line was added, then merged upward", and
 * treating its content as unrendered dropped the added words from every mode.
 *
 * `skipHiddenRuns` also treats a run whose DIRECT `w:rPr` sets `w:vanish` as rendering nothing.
 * Direct formatting decides the toggle outright, so that answer needs no style cascade; a run
 * hidden only through a style still counts as rendering, which keeps its line.
