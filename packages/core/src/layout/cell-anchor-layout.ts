// How an anchored object flowing inside a cell box relates to that box.
//
// Cell flow lays out more than table cells: header, footer, note and text-box stories reuse
// it, so "has a cell box" does not mean "is in a table". Every consumer (break-time wrap
// synthesis, record publication) reads one {@link CellAnchorScope} through
// {@link anchorLaidOutInCell}, so the wrap hole and the published object cannot disagree
// about where the object is. Each rule below was printed from Word 16.113 under modes
// absent, 12, 14, 15 and 16.
