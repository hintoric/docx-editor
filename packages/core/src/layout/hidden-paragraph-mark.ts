// Which paragraphs a hidden paragraph mark removes from the laid-out flow.
//
// `w:vanish` in the paragraph mark's run properties (17.3.1.29 `w:pPr/w:rPr`, 17.3.2.41) hides
// the mark itself, and `w:specVanish` (17.3.2.36) hides it even where hidden text is shown.
// A hidden mark draws no break: the paragraph runs into the one after it. When the paragraph
// shows nothing else either, that join leaves nothing on the page — no line box, and no
// spacing before or after. Laying such a paragraph out as an ordinary empty line put a full
// line of blank space, plus its spacing, wherever a document hides empty paragraphs.
//
// The condition is narrow on purpose, like the revision rule in `revision-visibility.ts`:
//
//   - The mark must be hidden by DIRECT formatting. Direct formatting decides a toggle
//     outright, so no style cascade is needed; a mark hidden through a style keeps its line.
//   - The paragraph must render nothing visible. A hidden mark after visible text merges that
//     text forward, and dropping the box would lose it, so such a paragraph keeps its box.
//   - A paragraph must follow in the same container to take the join. The last paragraph of a
//     story, cell, or content control, and one before a table, keeps its line.
//   - A paragraph carrying `w:sectPr` keeps its box, so section boundaries do not move.
//
// The paragraph stays in the tree and still advances list counters: numbering is a property
// of the document, not of what the page shows. {@link numberingFlowBlocks} gives list
// resolution the block list with those paragraphs put back.
//
// It also stays the neighbour that `w:contextualSpacing` (17.3.1.9) compares against. A
// paragraph after a removed run keeps or drops its space before by the style of the removed
// paragraph next to it, not by the visible paragraph beyond the run; the same holds for the
// space after of the paragraph before the run. The removed paragraph adds no spacing itself.
// {@link hiddenMarkNeighboursOf} carries those neighbours on the kept paragraphs.
