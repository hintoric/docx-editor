## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Drawings are typed canonical nodes in both anchoring forms

The canonical tree SHALL type `w:drawing` and its two children, `wp:inline` (`CT_Inline`) and `wp:anchor` (`CT_Anchor`), including `wp:extent`, `wp:effectExtent`, `wp:docPr`, `wp:cNvGraphicFramePr`, and the distance attributes. `CT_Anchor` SHALL additionally type `@simplePos`, `@relativeHeight`, `@behindDoc`, `@locked`, `@layoutInCell`, `@allowOverlap`, `wp:simplePos`, `wp:positionH`, `wp:positionV`, and the wrap element.

#### Scenario: Inline drawing types

- **WHEN** a `w:drawing` containing `wp:inline` is loaded
- **THEN** it is a typed inline drawing carrying its extent, effect extent, and `wp:docPr`

#### Scenario: Anchored drawing types

- **WHEN** a `w:drawing` containing `wp:anchor` is loaded, as the comprehensive fixture's one floating image
- **THEN** every anchor attribute above is typed, including `@relativeHeight="952500"`, `@behindDoc="0"`, `@allowOverlap="1"`, and `@layoutInCell="1"`

#### Scenario: Unedited round trip

- **WHEN** all eleven drawings in the comprehensive fixture are loaded and serialized without an edit
- **THEN** each matches its input by canonical tree fingerprint, including `wp:effectExtent` and the empty `a:srcRect`

### Requirement: The picture payload is typed, and non-picture graphics are not faked

`CT_Picture` SHALL be typed: `pic:nvPicPr`, `a:blip` with `r:embed` or `r:link`, `a:srcRect` (`CT_RelativeRect`), the fill mode, `a:xfrm` including rotation and `@flipH` / `@flipV`, and `a:prstGeom`. A `w:drawing` whose graphic data is not a picture SHALL remain a typed drawing with a `generic` graphic payload.

#### Scenario: Picture types

- **WHEN** a drawing's graphic data is a `pic:pic`
- **THEN** its blip, source rectangle, transform, and geometry are typed

#### Scenario: Empty source rectangle means no crop

- **WHEN** `a:srcRect` is present and empty, as it is on all eleven drawings in the comprehensive fixture
- **THEN** no crop is applied
- **AND** serializing re-emits the empty element rather than dropping it or filling in zeros

#### Scenario: Chart or diagram reserves its extent

- **WHEN** a drawing's graphic data is a chart, a diagram, a group, or a text box
- **THEN** it is a typed drawing with a generic graphic payload, it reserves its declared `wp:extent`, and it paints a placeholder
- **AND** it is NOT reported as a supported picture

#### Scenario: Placeholder is honest

- **WHEN** a placeholder is painted for an unsupported graphic
- **THEN** it is visually distinguishable from a rendered image and carries the reason

### Requirement: Alt text is preserved as authored

`wp:docPr/@descr` and `@name` SHALL be preserved exactly as authored and exposed for reading and writing. They SHALL NOT be normalised, trimmed to a length, or generated.

#### Scenario: Alt text round-trips

- **WHEN** a drawing declares `@name="banner"` and `@descr="Test banner"`
- **THEN** both survive an unedited round trip

#### Scenario: Missing alt text is not invented

- **WHEN** a drawing declares no `@descr`
- **THEN** saving does not add one

### Requirement: Embedded media is resolved, validated, and bounded

Media SHALL be resolved from the package part named by `r:embed` through the existing safe-target relationship rules. When the declared type and signature name different supported raster formats, the signature SHALL select header validation, decoding, and the published MIME type. Unknown signatures and mismatches between raster, vector, and preserved formats SHALL be refused. Dimension and byte-size limits SHALL be enforced **before** any allocation sized by a file-supplied number.

#### Scenario: Embedded PNG resolves

- **WHEN** a drawing's `r:embed` names a PNG part in the package
- **THEN** the bytes are read from that part and painted

#### Scenario: Raster content type mismatch

- **WHEN** a part declared as PNG contains valid JPEG bytes
- **THEN** the JPEG signature selects the decoder and the drawing paints normally

#### Scenario: Unknown signature

- **WHEN** a raster part has no recognized image signature
- **THEN** the drawing reserves its extent and paints a placeholder, and the document still loads

#### Scenario: Oversized media is refused before allocation

- **WHEN** a media part declares dimensions or a decompressed size beyond the configured bound
- **THEN** it is refused before an allocation sized by that number is made, and a placeholder is painted

#### Scenario: Traversal in a relationship target

- **WHEN** a media relationship target contains `..` or a leading `/`
- **THEN** it is refused by the existing safe-target rules and no part outside the package is read

#### Scenario: One media part, several drawings

- **WHEN** three drawings reference `rId14`, as the comprehensive fixture's do
- **THEN** the part is decoded once and shared, and deleting one drawing does not remove the part while another still references it

### Requirement: Embedded SVG is painted, never scripted

An embedded `image/svg+xml` part SHALL be painted from its validated bytes rather than refused as an unsupported format. It SHALL be presented so that scripts inside the file cannot run and references inside the file cannot be fetched. Its intrinsic size SHALL be read from the root element's `width`, `height`, and `viewBox`, and SHALL be treated as metadata only: layout SHALL use the authored `wp:extent`, and no allocation SHALL be sized by the value.

#### Scenario: Embedded SVG renders

- **WHEN** a drawing's `r:embed` names an SVG part in the package
- **THEN** the bytes are painted at the authored extent, and no decode of raster pixels is attempted

#### Scenario: Script and external references in an SVG stay inert

- **WHEN** an SVG containing a `script` element and a reference to a remote resource is painted
- **THEN** the script does not run and no network request is made

#### Scenario: Declared type still has to match the signature

- **WHEN** a part declared as TIFF carries SVG bytes, or a part declared as SVG carries raster bytes
- **THEN** it is refused as a signature mismatch rather than rendered

#### Scenario: An unreadable root is not guessed at

- **WHEN** the root `svg` element cannot be read within the bounded scan window
- **THEN** the drawing reserves its extent and paints a placeholder, and the document still loads

#### Scenario: Intrinsic size falls back rather than refusing

- **WHEN** the root declares percentage sizes, no sizing attributes, or a size beyond the configured dimension bound
- **THEN** the intrinsic size falls back to the `viewBox`, then to the replaced-element default, and an out-of-range value is clamped rather than refused

### Requirement: No image causes a network or filesystem fetch

A `r:link` relationship, a `TargetMode="External"` image relationship, or any remote reference inside a drawing SHALL NOT be fetched at load, layout, paint, or save. The relationship SHALL be preserved, the drawing SHALL reserve its extent, and a placeholder SHALL be painted stating that the image is external.

#### Scenario: Linked image is not fetched

- **WHEN** a document containing a `r:link` image is loaded, laid out, painted, and saved
- **THEN** no network request and no filesystem read outside the package is made
- **AND** the relationship survives the round trip

#### Scenario: External-mode relationship is not fetched

- **WHEN** an image relationship declares `TargetMode="External"`
- **THEN** the same rule applies regardless of the URL's scheme or host

#### Scenario: Placeholder explains itself

- **WHEN** an external image's placeholder is painted
- **THEN** it states that the image is external and was not loaded, so the user is not left thinking the file is corrupt

#### Scenario: Loading an image later is an explicit action

- **WHEN** a user explicitly asks to load an external image
- **THEN** the fetch is gated on that gesture, the URL is validated against the allowlisted schemes, and it never happens automatically on open

### Requirement: Drawing hyperlinks are sanitized and require a gesture

`a:hlinkClick` on a drawing SHALL be preserved and its target sanitized. Activation SHALL require an explicit user gesture and an allowlisted scheme.

#### Scenario: Unsafe scheme is not navigable

- **WHEN** a drawing's `a:hlinkClick` names a `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, or `file:` target
- **THEN** activation is refused
- **AND** the authored value is preserved, escaped, on save

#### Scenario: Safe target requires a click

- **WHEN** a drawing carries an `https:` hyperlink
- **THEN** nothing is opened on load, layout, or paint, and navigation happens only on an explicit activation

### Requirement: Image operations commit through the store

`TreeDocOp` SHALL include insert-image, replace-image, delete-image, resize-image, set-image-crop, set-image-alt-text, set-wrap-mode, and set-anchor-position. Each SHALL validate and commit atomically.

#### Scenario: Insert adds part, override, and relationship

- **WHEN** insert-image runs with image bytes
- **THEN** the media part, its `[Content_Types].xml` override, its relationship, and the drawing node are added in one transaction
- **AND** the part name does not collide with an existing part

#### Scenario: Insert validates before writing

- **WHEN** insert-image is given bytes that do not decode as a supported format
- **THEN** it is refused with `invalidArgs` and no part, override, or relationship is written

#### Scenario: Delete collects an orphaned part

- **WHEN** the last drawing referencing a media part is deleted
- **THEN** the part, its override, and its relationship are removed in the same transaction

#### Scenario: Delete keeps a shared part

- **WHEN** one of three drawings referencing the same part is deleted
- **THEN** the part is kept

#### Scenario: Resize and crop never re-encode

- **WHEN** resize-image or set-image-crop runs
- **THEN** only `wp:extent` and `a:srcRect` change, and the media part's bytes are byte-identical afterwards

#### Scenario: Impact class is honest

- **WHEN** an image operation changes an extent or a wrap mode
- **THEN** the published `ModelChange` carries an impact class no narrower than `flow-structural`

### Requirement: Drawings satisfy both D9 oracles

Parts containing drawings SHALL pass the canonical tree fingerprint on an unedited round trip and the save/reopen semantic digest after an image operation. Non-XML media parts SHALL be byte-identical unless the operation replaced them.

#### Scenario: Media parts are untouched by an unrelated edit

- **WHEN** a document is loaded, a body paragraph is edited, and the package is saved
- **THEN** all four PNG parts are byte-identical to the input

#### Scenario: Resized image reopens equivalent

- **WHEN** an image is resized, saved, and reopened
- **THEN** the digest reports the new extent, the unchanged crop, the unchanged alt text, and byte-identical media

### Requirement: Drawing identifiers are allocated unique, non-zero, and in range

Allocation SHALL seed from the maximum drawing id already present in the document, plus one, and SHALL NOT derive an id from a clock, timestamp, random source, or hash. It SHALL never allocate `0`.

`wp:docPr/@id` is `ST_DrawingElementId` — `xsd:unsignedInt`, so `0` to `4294967295` — and it is **required**. Word additionally expects it unique within the document and treats `0` as invalid; a package where every drawing carries `id="0"` renders only one image.

Relationship ids for new media SHALL likewise be allocated from the existing relationship ids of the target part, and SHALL NOT be a clock or random value.

#### Scenario: Seeded from the document

- **WHEN** an image is inserted into a document whose highest `wp:docPr/@id` is 11
- **THEN** the allocated id is 12, not a clock-derived value

#### Scenario: Never zero

- **WHEN** a drawing id is allocated
- **THEN** it is greater than zero

#### Scenario: Duplicate ids on load do not become duplicate ids on save

- **WHEN** a loaded package carries `id="0"` on every drawing — the template-engine case
- **THEN** every drawing still renders
- **AND** ids authored by this engine are unique, without silently rewriting the loaded ones on an unedited round trip

#### Scenario: Exported ids stay inside unsignedInt

- **WHEN** a package containing engine-authored drawings is saved and opened in Word
- **THEN** it opens without a repair prompt
- **AND** a conformance test asserts the bound directly
