# docx-editor.dev

WYSIWYG editor and rendering engine for DOCX. Output must match MS Word: fonts, theme colors, styles, tables, headers/footers, section layout.

## Local instructions

Before starting work, read `local/AGENTS.md` if it exists. Follow its additional instructions throughout this checkout.

The `local/` directory is gitignored. Keep its contents private and do not copy them into committed files or pull requests. If the file is absent, continue with these shared instructions.

## Communication

Write all replies in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.

- Use the active voice.
- Keep sentences to 20 words or fewer.
- Give one idea in each sentence.
- Use simple tenses: present, past, and future.
- Use the same word for the same idea each time.
- Do not use idioms, slang, or jargon.
- Keep paragraphs to 6 sentences or fewer.

Keep technical items exact. File paths, function names, flags, and numbers do not change. For example, write `packages/core/src/layout/semantic-layout.ts` and `w:contextualSpacing` in full.

In user-facing text, always use the name `EigenPal Pro License`. Do not rename the legal license files or `LicenseRef-EigenPal-Pro-Evaluation-1.0` metadata.

## Public API compatibility

All public document automation APIs must keep the Microsoft Word Office.js shape. Match member names, signatures, enum values, return types, and `load()` / `context.sync()` behavior. Use existing Office.js members when they express the operation. Do not add competing convenience methods. This includes server agents: set `document.changeTrackingMode`, then use standard edits such as `range.insertText(text, 'Replace')` and `range.delete()` to create redlines.

Compatibility includes behavior. Explicitly refuse unsupported modes or operations; never silently approximate them. Record supported subsets and differences in `packages/editor-api/compat/manifest.json` and public documentation. Extend the pinned Office.js reference, conformance fixtures, and runtime tests when adding public members. Keep host creation, collaboration transport, and job orchestration separate from the Office-shaped document model. These infrastructure APIs have no Office.js equivalent. Do not claim full Office.js compatibility from subset conformance.

Run `bun run --filter '@docx-editor.dev/editor-api' compat:report` to check document editing methods and property writes against pinned Office.js signatures. The command checks both the broad editing inventory and an 81-member profile. Reads and host setup are excluded. See [Compatibility reports](packages/editor-api/compat/README.md) for scope definitions and maintenance. CI reports editing percentages without blocking merges. Full results are in `packages/editor-api/compat/reports/`. Record per-endpoint runtime differences in `packages/editor-api/compat/runtime-notes.json`; signature matches do not prove runtime equivalence.

### Office.js developer experience

- Load only the properties needed. Use explicit property names in examples.
- Batch independent loads and writes. Keep `context.sync()` outside per-item read loops.
- Use an explicit final `await context.sync()` when commands remain queued.
- Keep proxies within their `run()` lifetime. Pass plain data to models and job queues.
- Explain intentional sync boundaries for progressive, separately reviewable suggestions.
- Handle stable error codes. On stale reads, re-read and reconsider; never blindly replay model edits.
- Make supported host and operation limits visible in types, JSDoc, examples, and compatibility documentation.
- Never disable tracking automatically to make an unsupported tracked edit succeed.

Use `packages/editor-api/OFFICE_JS_GUIDE.md` as the reference for agent-facing examples. Dedicated API guides and the complete public member directory live in `docs/site/content/editor-api/`. Keep the relevant guide and `reference.mdx` current when adding or changing public API behavior.

## Packages

One engine. Thin chrome on top.

| Package | What | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core` | **The engine.** `store/` (canonical tree, ops, OPC read/write), `layout/` (DOM-free), `output/` (paint), `editor/` (facade, surface, chrome registry), `contracts/`, `binding/`, `automation/` | published, external to `react` |
| `react` | The adapter: provider + hooks, holds no editing state | published |
| `i18n` | Shared strings | published |
| `editor-api` | `DocxEditor` automation object model, headless/server | published, Pro license |
| `pro` | Review module (comments, tracked changes) + custom nodes, as `EditorModule`s | published, Pro license |
| `docx-to-markdown` | DOCX to Markdown conversion with pages and media | published |
| `docx-to-pdf` | DOCX to PDF conversion on Node.js | release-enabled, EigenPal Pro License |
| `fonts` | Metric-compatible substitutes for Word's defaults | published |
| `vue` | The Vue 3 adapter twin, parity-gated against `react` | published |
| `nuxt` | Nuxt module over the Vue adapter | WIP, private |

React and Vue both ship; the parity gates below keep them from drifting.

**The engine must resolve to ONE copy.** It holds module-level state — the HarfBuzz shaper and its cache budget, the grapheme boundary strategy, layout caches keyed by object identity. Two copies in a tree do not crash; they load the shaper twice and miss every identity-keyed cache, quietly. So `core` is external to `react` (not inlined) and a **peer** of both `react` and `pro`, which makes the package manager resolve one and say so at install when it cannot. Both adapters assert their own dependency shape: `packages/{react,pro}/src/__tests__/package-dependencies.test.ts`. Never move `core` back to a regular `dependency`.

Inside `core`, each directory is a guarded lane with a declared dependency edge and environment (`store` and `layout` are DOM-free, `binding` is the only PM-aware one). The DAG is machine-readable in `packages/core/src/__tests__/core-lane-graph.ts` and documented in `docs/architecture/production-engine-packages.md`. A lane taking a new dependency edits that DAG.

Active production authority: `openspec/changes/typed-ooxml-paragraph-editor/`. Superseded proposals are not requirements.

## Architecture — one pipeline

```
bytes → readOoxmlPackage (bounded OPC/XML) → canonical OoxmlNode tree per part
→ TreeDocumentStore → semantic-layout → semantic-paint → serializeOoxmlPart
```

**The tree store is the only source of truth.** Painted pages ARE the editable surface — contenteditable, but the DOM is a picture: browser mutations are prevented and re-expressed as tree ops.

**ProseMirror is only a projection** of one tree revision. The reverse direction never reconstructs the tree from it: it diffs the edited doc against the tree it came from, emits the smallest `TreeDocOp`s that explain the difference, or refuses outright (`TreeBindingRejection`). A silently-dropped edit is worse than a refused one, because only the refusal can be reconciled. PM exists only in `core/src/binding/`; `store`, `layout`, `output` and `contracts` are PM-free, enforced by `store/__tests__/prosemirror-isolation.test.ts`.

- **Canonical tree** — typed kinds where layout needs them (paragraph/run/table); everything else is a lossless `generic` node. Invalid or misplaced known elements demote to generic. Unknown content never locks editing.
- **Fidelity** — structural, gated by two D9 oracles: `canonicalOoxmlFingerprint` and a save/reopen `semanticDigest`. Modeled XML parts re-emit normalized; byte identity applies to non-XML parts only.
- **Mutation** — `TreeDocumentStore.transact` over `TreeDocOp`s (node id + UTF-16 offset) is the only write path. The node index makes cell and nested paragraphs ordinary. Cross-cell joins refused (`not-adjacent-siblings`).
- **Layout** (`layout/semantic-layout.ts`) — DOM-free, injected `TextMeasurer`, points everywhere (twips convert at property-read boundaries). `storyBlocks` walks body/hdr/ftr roots and flattens block SDTs. Tables: row pagination, header-row repeats, vMerge, clamped gridSpan. Headers/footers laid out once per variant at flow height, attached per page. Incremental: per-block cache keys + flow checkpoints + convergence; a no-change pass returns previous pages by identity. Paragraph fidelity resolves through `layout/style-cascade.ts`: `w:spacing` line rules, first-line/hanging indents, `w:contextualSpacing`, `w:pBdr` on all edges, tab stops and leaders, `w:vanish` (not measured, not painted), list markers from `numbering.xml`, table styles via `basedOn` gated by `w:tblLook`.
- **Selection** — maps only through `data-paragraph-id`/`data-start`. Page furniture is `contenteditable=false` + `[data-docx-hf]`, excluded from selection.
- **Caret** (`editor/surface-caret.ts`) — the engine paints its own and suppresses the native one (`caret-color: transparent` on the pages layer) for exactly as long as it does. Geometry comes from `caretAt` on the layout, never the DOM, so an empty paragraph gets a caret too. The element is furniture (`data-docx-marker`, `contenteditable=false`) on the page content box, not on a line. Fails soft: range selection, IME composition or an unplaced position hands the native caret back rather than leaving none.
- **Input** (`editor/surface-input.ts`) — one keymap for every host (Word's paragraph shortcuts, `beforeinput` dispatch, clipboard, IME readback) as factories over `PaginatedSurface`, so hosts cannot drift into separate hand-written keymaps.
- **`createDocxEditor`** (`editor/docx-editor.ts`) — the full `Editor` contract over the surface; unimplemented reads return typed empty values. `snapshot()` is version-cached: same reference until state moves, sub-objects reference-stable (`useSyncExternalStore` contract), `perf` outside it. `attach(el)`/`detach()` split creation from mounting; detach remounts from saved bytes (undo/caret reset).
- **Chrome registry** (`editor/chrome-controls.ts`) — `CHROME_GROUPS` is the toolbar taxonomy; `ChromeSlotId` (`text.bold`, `font.family`, …) is public API, so renames are breaking. `commandForSlot`/`commandForSlotValue` is the command table; `toolbarCommandState`/`runToolbarCommand` give shared can-before-exec. `ChromeControlState` says HOW a control dispatches (`command`/`value`/`save`), never whether it is enabled — enabled state has exactly one source, `toolbarCommandState`. Unwired slots render disabled with the engine's reason.

## React adapter

`DocxEditor.Root` (owns the instance, created in an effect, StrictMode-safe, container-less) → `.Viewport` (the engine's load-bearing scroll classes) → `.Content` (attach/detach in a layout effect). All chrome is a hook consumer.

- `useDocxEditor()`, `useEditorState(selector, isEqual?)` (one multiplexed subscription + slice memoization — a page selector must NOT re-render on a bold toggle), `useEditorCommand(slotId)` → `{execute, isActive, isEnabled, disabledReason}`, `useEditorEvent`, `useFontFamily`.
- `DocxEditor.Toolbar` arrangement derives FROM `CHROME_GROUPS`, never hand-listed. Customization ladder: `className`/`data-active` → `icon` prop → `asChild` → in-place slot override (`hidden` removes, `preset={false}` opts out) → raw hooks. Complex parts are compounds (`FontFamily.Trigger/Content/Item`) over a part-level context.
- `<DocxEditor>` (props + the 7-member `DocxEditorRef`) is sugar over the same primitives. Parity-contract gated; do not widen the ref.
- Chrome mousedown must `preventDefault()` (skip INPUT/SELECT/TEXTAREA) or it steals the caret.
- Exported names describe capabilities, never engine internals (no "tree").

Check current feature support in `docs/site/data/word-features.ts` and the public API snapshots in `docs/api/`. React and Vue expose provider composition, shared editing commands, and live zoom updates. Keep capability claims aligned with those sources.

## Verify

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run check:parity
bun run api:check
bun run i18n:validate
openspec validate typed-ooxml-paragraph-editor --strict
```

- `bun run lint`'s errors are the `max-lines` caps (1000 lines for most files, per-file caps up to 3500 for the handful already past it) and the `no-restricted-syntax` bans (HTML-from-strings sinks in `packages/*/src` non-test code, varargs array spread in `core/src/{store,layout}`). Nothing else catches the caps, so adding to a large file passes typecheck and the whole suite and fails CI. Extract; do not raise the cap — `scripts/check-eslint-max-lines-globs.mjs` also fails a cap that drifts more than 150 lines above its file. Lint covers `examples/*/src` as well as `packages/*/src` — the demos hit the same line caps.
- `bun run test` shards the suite one process per file across a worker pool (`scripts/test/run-parallel.mjs`, `--jobs N` to pin the width). That is also what CI runs. `bun test` still works and is the one to reach for when you want a single file, `-t`, or `--watch`; `bun run test:serial` is the whole suite the old way.
- The pool is machine-aware, and must stay that way: the heavy OOXML-oracle files peak at multiple GiB each and slowest-first starts them together, which once froze a 48 GiB machine (fourteen workers, ~94 GiB footprint, WindowServer watchdog death). The runner caps width by installed memory, splits width and budget between concurrent runs on the machine (tmpdir registry), and gates dispatch on each file's measured peak footprint plus live memory pressure. `--jobs` pins the width but never lifts the gate. A single test file that needs more than a few GiB is a bug to file, not a budget to raise.
- A file that leaves state on `document` can only be caught by the serial run — per-file processes hide it. Scope DOM queries to the container you mounted.
- `git commit --no-verify` is fine locally, but `bun run format` and `bun run lint` are not optional — the hook runs both, and they are the two gates nothing else covers. Run the other relevant scoped checks too, and report a bypassed failing gate instead of calling it passing.
- Compare the run against the non-clean baseline in the active change.
- `bun run format` before pushing.

## Parity and styling

Platform-neutral logic goes in the engine; adapter-only glue may diverge. `scripts/parity/parity.contract.json` enumerates paired `DocxEditorProps`/`DocxEditorRef` members. Adding an adapter prop or ref method: edit the adapter, `bun run api:extract`, add it to the right bucket (`paired`, `deferredInVue`, `pairedViaInheritance`, `vueExclusive`), rerun `bun run check:parity-contract`.

All editor chrome CSS and color tokens live in the core stylesheet; adapters only `@import` it (enforced by `bun run check:adapter-css-thin`). Never hardcode hex/rgba — use `--doc-*` tokens or shadcn utilities. The document canvas is not themed; it stays Word-faithful.

## Public API

API Extractor snapshots live in `docs/api/<pkg-slug>/<entry>.api.md`; CI runs `bun run api:check`. On drift: `bun run api:extract`, commit. Changing a `@public` symbol: tag it in TSDoc, rebuild, re-extract, commit. `bun run docs:json` generates consumer JSON (gitignored, CI smoke test).

Vue composables must declare a named `Use<Name>Return` interface and annotate the return type, or core's internal types leak into the snapshot.

## Security — untrusted input

**Every value from a DOCX, pasted HTML or embedded part is attacker-controlled.** A `.docx` is a zip of XML the sender fully controls: font names, hyperlink targets, shape attrs, image rels, run text. Sanitize at the bounded parse/trust boundary (XML read + typed/generic tree construction), never at render time, so every downstream sink receives a sanitized projection. Contract: `openspec/changes/typed-ooxml-paragraph-editor/specs/typed-ooxml-canonical-tree/`.

Audit these whenever you touch parsing, serialization, `output/semantic-paint*`, clipboard or print:

- **No HTML from strings** — no `innerHTML`/`outerHTML`/`insertAdjacentHTML`/ `document.write` on file-derived values. Use `createElement(NS)` + `setAttribute`/`textContent`.
- **URLs through `sanitizeHref`** — allowlist `http(s)/mailto/tel/ftp`, drop `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:`/`file:`, strip embedded tab/LF/CR. Every `href`, image `hlinkHref`, and `window.open(...)` arg.
- **Escape strings interpolated into CSS** — `@font-face` family names, and any inline `style` built from file data.
- **XML** — no DTD/external entity resolution (XXE), no nested entity expansion (billion-laughs).
- **Zip** — decompression ratio/size cap; reject part/rel/media paths with `..` or a leading `/`.
- **No zero-click external fetch** — never auto-load `TargetMode="External"` rels, remote `src`, or CSS `url()`/`@import`. Gate remote loads behind an explicit user action.
- **Resource limits** — cap recursion depth (nested tables/shapes/SDT/groups) and element counts. Never feed a file-supplied number into allocation, `.repeat()` or a loop bound. No catastrophic-backtracking regex on file-derived strings.
- **Escape on save** — `escapeXml` every attacker-derived string; never template a raw value into markup.
- **Prototype pollution** — guard `JSON.parse` merges and any XML-attribute-name → object-key assignment against `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype`.
- **Field codes / OLE** — never execute or auto-resolve field instructions (DDE, `INCLUDE*`) or embedded OLE/macro content. Render inert.

```bash
grep -rnE "innerHTML|outerHTML|insertAdjacentHTML|v-html|document\\.write|window\\.open\\(|\\.href\\s*=|font-family:.*\\$\\{" packages --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.vue" | grep -viE "test|\\.spec\\."
```

Fix sibling sinks when you fix one. The HTML sinks in that grep are also lint errors (`SECURITY_SINK_SELECTORS` in `eslint.config.js`), so a new one fails `bun run lint`; the grep still covers what the AST selectors cannot (`v-html`, raw `href` assignment, CSS interpolation).

## i18n

`packages/i18n/en.json` is source of truth; other locales mirror its shape with `null` = fall back to English. A missing key fails CI.

```ts
const { t } = useTranslation();
t('formattingBar.bold');
t('navigation.find.counter', { current: 3, total: 15 });
```

New string: add to `en.json`, use `t('key')`, `bun run i18n:fix`. New language: `bun run i18n:new <code>`, fill nulls, `bun run i18n:status`. Never hardcode user-facing English in components.

## Docs site

Authored here in `docs/site/content/` (MDX), synced by the site repo at build time. Feature-support claims live in `docs/site/data/word-features.ts` (typed matrix), never hand-written in prose. A PR that changes user-visible behavior updates both.

READMEs, guides, developer docs, feature descriptions, and release notes follow the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) ([highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) is the summary):

- [Voice and tone](https://developers.google.com/style/tone) — conversational and friendly, not frivolous. No buzzwords, idioms, exclamation marks, or pop-culture references. In procedures, never "simply", "easy", "just", "quickly", or "please".
- Grammar — [second person](https://developers.google.com/style/person) ("you", not "we"), [active voice](https://developers.google.com/style/voice), [present tense](https://developers.google.com/style/tense), American spelling. State the condition before the instruction ("If X, click Y").
- [Timeless](https://developers.google.com/style/timeless-documentation) — no "currently", "new", "soon", "as of this writing". Document what the product does; never pre-announce features.
- [Headings](https://developers.google.com/style/headings) — sentence case in all titles, headings, and navigation.
- [Lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists) — numbered for sequences, bulleted otherwise; parallel structure; serial (Oxford) commas.
- [Text formatting](https://developers.google.com/style/text-formatting) — code font for filenames, identifiers, console output, and placeholders; bold for UI elements only; italics only for term definitions and work titles.
- [Link text](https://developers.google.com/style/link-text) — a descriptive phrase that matches the target's title. Never "click here", "this article", or a bare URL. Introduce with "For more information, see …".
- [Code samples](https://developers.google.com/style/code-samples) — introduce each sample with text; wrap lines at 80 characters; mark omissions with a comment, not an ellipsis.
- [Accessibility](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility) — proper heading hierarchy, alt text on every image, no images of text or terminal output, no directional language ("above", "below"), meaning never carried by color alone.
- [Global audience](https://developers.google.com/style/translation) — short sentences (26 words or fewer), one idea per sentence, acronyms defined on first use, no culturally specific references.
- The [word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list) settles spelling and usage; use unambiguous [dates and times](https://developers.google.com/style/dates-times).

**Two `meta.json` must agree.** The `"root": true` `docs/site/content/meta.json` drives the sidebar with full paths; each subfolder has its own. Register a new page in BOTH, or it is URL-reachable but missing from the sidebar.

**Diagrams are mermaid**, in a ` ```mermaid ` fence — not ASCII box drawing. ASCII renders at whatever the code block's font does, wraps on a phone, and is unreadable to a screen reader; mermaid scales and picks up the site theme. Keep it to the shape being explained (a flow, a sequence, a state machine); a diagram that just restates the prose earns nothing.

OOXML reference: `reference/quick-ref/wordprocessingml.md`, `themes-colors.md`; schemas in `reference/ecma-376/part1/schemas/`. PDFs are gitignored — run `bun run reference:fetch` once when needed.

## Releasing

Every code PR gets a changeset (`bun changeset`, or a correct hand-written `.changeset/*.md`). Skip only for test/docs/CI-only PRs.

- The frontmatter package name must exactly match a published package and the bump must be `patch`/`minor`/`major`. A wrong name crashes the Release workflow — copy it from an existing changeset.
- Published packages are one fixed group: declare one bump, the rest follow.
- Default `patch`; `minor` for additive public API; `major` for breaks.
- The summary lands verbatim in CHANGELOG: consumer-facing, what changed not how, `Fixes #N` at the end if relevant. No emojis, no marketing.
- Keep the summary minimal: one sentence, two at most. No bullet lists, no implementation detail.

Collaboration format compatibility has a separate policy after 2.18. Relevant PRs must include a decision from `bun run collaboration:change`. Format changes require at least a minor package release and migration instructions. Public API breaks still follow the major-version rule. See [Collaboration compatibility](docs/architecture/collaboration-compatibility.md).

Never push the `chore: release` commit by hand, delete `.changeset/*.md` outside `changeset version`, or hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` / `package.json#version`.

**Third-party notices.** Every publishable package ships a `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` reproducing the license of each package esbuild inlines into its bundles, because MIT/Apache-2.0 both require the notice to travel with the copy. Only genuinely inlined code counts: core declares fast-xml-parser, fflate and prosemirror-\* as real `dependencies` with no `noExternal`, so esbuild leaves them external and npm installs them with their own licenses. The one exception is harfbuzzjs, which core's ESM build inlines (`noExternal`) so browser bundlers never see its Node-only `module` import — core's notice reproduces its MIT text, and every other package generates an empty notice. Both results are correct, not a broken generator — what would be wrong is a bundled dependency missing its text, which fails the run outright. The Release workflow generates it from `dist/metafile-*.json` just before publishing; the file is gitignored, so regenerate with `bun run build:packages && bun run notices:generate`. `notices:check` compares against the CURRENT `dist/`, so it only means anything right after a build and reports "missing" on a clean tree by design. The run is all-or-nothing: a tsup config that stops emitting `metafile: true`, a bundled dependency with no license text, or a `files` array that forgets the notice fails it — and a failure deletes the notices rather than shipping a stale one. A publishable package that is not a tsup bundle has no metafile and fails until it gets an attribution path; `packages/fonts` carries OFL text in `licenses/`, which no metafile can see.

## Conventions

- **PRs** — short factual title (conventional-commit prefix); body is the minimum the diff doesn't show, often one sentence. A PR that resolves an issue MUST end its BODY with `Fixes #N` — GitHub links and auto-closes only from closing keywords in the body or in commits, never from the title, so a title-only `(fixes #N)` leaves the issue open after merge. No `@`-mentions, unrelated issue numbers, file lists, tooling footers or emojis. Write the body in the [Google developer documentation style](https://developers.google.com/style), the same guide the docs site follows: second person, active voice, present tense, sentence-case headings, American spelling, short sentences, one idea each. Code font for identifiers and filenames; bold for UI elements only.
- **Bugs** — `gh issue view <N> --repo eigenpal/docx-editor`. Dev server `bun run dev` → `http://localhost:5173/`. Live demo `http://docx-editor.dev/editor`. Commit `fix: ... (fixes #N)`. Screenshots → `screenshots/`.
- **Issue labels** — every issue gets exactly ONE `area:*` and ONE `priority:*` label; the taxonomy table lives in `README.md` under "Issue conventions". Optional `component:*` names the package. The labels are the source of truth for the public roadmap board (org project 2): `.github/workflows/sync-labels-to-project.yml` mirrors them into the board's Area/Priority single-select fields. An option name must keep matching its label slug (lowercase, spaces→dashes) or the sync warns and skips; an issue with no `area:*` label is removed from the board; two labels of one prefix clear the field. ALWAYS file an issue with both labels AND a native issue type: `gh issue create --type Bug|Feature|Task --label "area:...,priority:..."` (`gh issue edit <N> --type ...` to fix one). Never leave an issue without a type or an area.
- **ESM only** — no `require()`.
- **Tailwind** — scoped to `.docx-editor`; the scoping is baked into `dist/editor.css` at core build time (`scripts/build-core-styles.mjs` + `packages/core/tailwind.dist.config.cjs`), so the shipped file carries no raw `@tailwind` directive. Rendered output isn't always protected, so use inline styles on painted elements. Never put Tailwind utilities on the element that carries `docx-editor` itself — scoped utilities only match descendants.
- **Focus stealing** — painted pages are the editable surface, so any mousedown reaching them moves the caret.
- **Icons** — inline SVG (Material Symbol paths), not a font. A missing name renders raw text.
